Every call of this function should be matched with JPU_EncGetOutputInfo() with
the same handle. Without calling a pair of these funtions, applications cannot
call any other API functions except for JPU_IsBusy(),
JPU_EncGetBitstreamBuffer(), and JPU_EncUpdateBitstreamBuffer().
@endverbatim
* @param handle [Input] An encoder handle obtained from JPU_EncOpen()
* @param param [Input] A pointer to JpgEncParam type structure which describes
picture encoding parameters for the current encoder instance.
* @return
@verbatim
*JPG_RET_SUCCESS*::
Operation was done successfully, which means encoding a new frame was started
successfully.

NOTE: This return value does not mean that encoding a frame was completed
successfully.

*JPG_RET_INVALID_HANDLE*::
This means the given handle for current API function call was invalid (for
example, not initialized yet, improper function call for the given handle,
etc.).

*JPG_RET_FRAME_NOT_COMPLETE*::
This means frame decoding or encoding operation was not completed yet, so the
given API function call cannot be performed this time. A frame encoding or
decoding operation should be completed by calling JPU_EncGetOutputInfo() or
JPU_DecGetOutputInfo(). Even though the result of the current frame operation is
not necessary, applications should call JPU_EncGetOutputInfo() or
JPU_DecGetOutputInfo() to proceed this function call.

*JPG_RET_INVALID_PARAM*::
The given argument parameter, param, was invalid, which means it has a null
pointer, or given values for some member variables are improper values.

/**
* @brief
This function gets information of the output of encoding. Application can know
about picture type, the address and size of the generated bitstream, the number
of generated slices, the end addresses of the slices, and macroblock bit
position information. Host application should call this function after frame
encoding is finished, and before starting the further processing.
* @param handle [Input] An encoder handle obtained from JPU_EncOpen().
* @param info [Output] A pointer to a JpgEncOutputInfo  type structure which
describes picture encoding results for the current encoder instance.
* @return
@verbatim
*JPG_RET_SUCCESS*::
Operation was done successfully, which means the output information of current
frame encoding was received successfully.

*JPG_RET_INVALID_HANDLE*::
This means the given handle for current API function call was invalid (for
example, not initialized yet, improper function call for the given handle,
etc.).

*JPG_RET_WRONG_CALL_SEQUENCE*::
This means current API function call was invalid considering the allowed
sequences between API functions. An application might call this function before
calling JPU_EncStartOneFrame() successfully. This function should be called
after successful calling of JPU_EncStartOneFrame().

*JPG_RET_INVALID_PARAM*::
The given argument parameter, info, was invalid, which means it has a null
pointer, or given values for some member variables are improper values.

* @brief
@verbatim
This function is provided to let application have a certain level of freedom for
re-configuring encoder operation after creating an encoder instance. Some
options which can be changed dynamically during encoding as the video sequence
has been included. Some command-specific return codes are also presented.

The list of valid commands can be summarized as follows:

@* SET_JPG_USE_STUFFING_BYTE_FF
@* ENC_JPG_GET_HEADER
@* ENABLE_LOGGING
@* DISABLE_LOGGING
@endverbatim
* @param handle [Input] An encoder handle obtained from JPU_EncOpen()

* @param param [Input/Output] A pointer to command-specific data structure which
describes picture I/O parameters for the current encoder instance
* @return
@verbatim
*JPG_RET_INVALID_COMMAND*::
This means the given argument, cmd, was invalid which means the given cmd was
undefined, or not allowed in the current instance.

*JPG_RET_INVALID_PARAM*::
The given argument parameter, info, was invalid, which means it has a null
pointer, or given values for some member variables are improper values.

*JPG_RET_SUCCESS*::
Operation was done successfully, which means the given cmd was received
successfully.

*JPG_RET_INVALID_HANDLE*::
This means the given handle for current API function call was invalid (for
example, not initialized yet, improper function call for the given handle,
etc.).
